During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for certain medical devices, including personal protective equipment (PPE), may outpace the supply available to health care organizations because of the high demand and overall interruptions to the global supply chain. We recognize that the public may seek to use 3D printing to assist in meeting demand for certain products during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As part of our effort to protect the public to the extent possible, product design engineers at Cereble have designed a Face Shield to ameliorate the COVID-19 pandemic. The designed has been 3D printed several times and has been tested for its comfort and robustness.

Designers at Cereble have used SolidWorks 2020 to design this Face Shiled. Design files for the same have also been included.
